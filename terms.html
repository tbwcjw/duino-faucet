        attempts to automate the claiming process or engage in fraudulent activities will result in immediate suspension
        of access to the faucet.</p>
    <p>We value fair distribution and authentic engagement with our faucet. All users are required to manually make
        claims, adhering to the specified claim intervals and completing any necessary verification steps.</p>
